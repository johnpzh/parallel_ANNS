Building and Installing

Note: xcode is required to build the driver and dynamic library.

Requirements
____________
Building and installing requires make, cmake, gcc, and xcode.
It has been tested on the following system configurations:
    OS X 12.0.1, Xcode 13.1, Apple LLVM compiler 13.0.0

Build PCM and MacMSRDriver
-----------------
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. && cmake --build .

PCM utilities will be located in build/bin folder, libraries libpcm.dylib and libPcmMsr.dylib - in build/lib.

Automatic Install
-----------------
  cd build
  sudo make install

Install command loads the driver, installs the library into /usr/lib and installs the library headers into /usr/include.
Also PCM utilities are installing to /usr/local/sbin.

Manual Install
--------------
Build steps are the same.
To install do the following:
    1) load the driver by running src/MacMSRDriver/kextload.sh
    2) copy build/lib/libPcmMsr.dylib to a location on your path (auto-install uses /usr/lib)
    3) copy src/MacMSRDriver/MSRKernel.h to a location on your path (auto-install uses /usr/include)
    4) copy src/MacMSRDriver/MSRAccessorPublic.h as MSRAccessor.h to a location on your path (auto-install uses /usr/include)

kext Signatures
---------------
As of OS X El Capitan, kexts must be signed. So after building the kext, kextload.sh may fail with:

  /System/Library/Extensions/PcmMsrDriver.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) not loadable (reason unspecified); check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8).

In this event, you will need to either disable System Integrity Protection or sign the kext.
You can disable SIP by rebooting into Recovery (reboot, command-option-R), opening a shell, csrutil disable and reboot again.
Signing a kext is more involved. You can't self-sign and will first need to obtain a Developer ID from Apple:

  https://developer.apple.com/contact/kext/

With this ID, you can then sign your kext with codesign.

PCM Execution
----------------------
Now you can run ./pcm utility.
